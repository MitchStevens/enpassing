#+TITLE: Chords

* How do we interpret chords?
Given a chord, how do we interpret/name it for a user
Each note provides a certain amount of context
Musical intuition provides a certain amount of context
need some sort of metric for simplicity
#+begin_src haskell
newChord :: [Ctx r a] -> Ctx (Chord a)
#+end_src

** Is the chord an inversion? does it have a bass note?


* Method for naming chords
1. Figure out the most likely key
2. Accumulate musical context
   a. get context from notes;
   b. get context from intuition about chords
