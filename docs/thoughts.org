#+TITLE: Thoughts

* Datastructure to represent Chord Progressions
Could also represent scale progressions
    good for
~data Progression a~

* How do we encode musical context around an object?
Using the state monad to encode state is the obvious choice
Want to be able to compose musical objects with the same context
    This is state monad
    How do we compose objects with different musical contexts?
        rose tree of some sort???
    What sort of context should be encoded?
        General structure that allows any kind of context?

** Why do we need to store this context?
to figure out the key of a piece of music

* Problems
** Cyclic deps
Transposition requires Intervals, Intervals can be transposed
    - why should i be able to transpose an interval?

** What kinds of thing can be flattened?
accidentals?
Interval Quality?
    should this
