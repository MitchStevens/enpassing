#+TITLE: Enharmonic Equivalents

* Enharmonic: Same thing, different name
Notes, Chords, Scales, Intervals can all have different spellings
~shift~ should preserve enharmonic spelling
    Intervaa

** Enharmonically equivalent notes
Using only the three main accidentals (flat, natural, sharp),

#+begin_src
-  C# -  D# -  E# F# -  G# -  A# -  B#
C  -  D  -  E  F  -  G  -  A  -  B  -
-  Db    Eb Fb -  Gb -  Ab -  Bb -  Cb
#+end_src

** Improve spelling
We want to be able to prefer certain spellings of enharmonically equivalent notes.
*** How do we choose
We provide a particular key

#+begin_src haskell
class Enharmonic t where
    spell :: t -> Keyed t
#+end_src
